## Question 12


## **Solution**

If $r = 1$, this means there is a **perfect positive linear relationship** between the **explanatory** and **response** variables in simple linear regression.

This implies that:

* All data points lie exactly on a **line with a positive slope**.
* As the explanatory variable increases, the response variable increases in a **perfectly consistent** and **proportional** manner.
* The correlation is not just strong — it's **perfect**, meaning the regression line **predicts every value without error**.
* The **coefficient of determination $R^2$** would be 1, meaning **100% of the variability** in the response variable is explained by the explanatory variable.
