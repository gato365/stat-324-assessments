## Question 10

Question 10: 

A student writes:

“Since the overall (omnibus) F-test was significant, that means all the explanatory variables in the model are statistically significant.”

In 1 - 2 sentences, explain why this interpretation is correct or incorrect and how it should be corrected.


PTS: 4


\newpage

### **Model Solution:**

> This interpretation is **incorrect**. A significant omnibus F-test only tells us that **at least one** explanatory variable is significantly associated with the response variable, **not all** of them.



### **Rubric (Total: 4 Points)**

- **2 points:** “This is wrong because the F-test isn’t about all variables.”  
   *(Recognizes incorrectness but lacks clarity or specificity)*

- **0 points:** “This is correct because the F-test says they are all significant.”  
   *(Misunderstanding and incorrect claim)*
