Here are **model solutions and rubrics** for your three open-ended questions — aligned with your STAT 324 objectives and ready for grading in Canvas:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### ✅ Q8 – *Interpreting Coefficients Post-Transformation*

**Model Answer (Full Credit – 3/3):**

The slope of 0.004 means that for every 1-unit increase in RPM, the log₁₀ of the vibration intensity increases by 0.004. This tells us that as motor speed increases, the vibration intensity increases on a logarithmic scale, not directly in original units. The intercept of –0.75 indicates the predicted log₁₀ of vibration when RPM is 0, but this value is not meaningful in context since RPM = 0 is outside the realistic operating range **Rubric:**

| Component | Points |
|------------------------------------------------------|------------------|
| Correct interpretation of slope (multiplicative change per RPM) | 1 |
| Clear back-transformation from log₁₀ to original scale | 1 |
| Reasonable interpretation of intercept with acknowledgment of extrapolation | 1 |

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### ✅ Q9 – *Prediction at 1500 RPM*

**Model Answer (Full Credit – 3/3):**

We are given the model: **log₁₀(vibration) = –0.75 + 0.004 × RPM**

Substituting RPM = 1500: log₁₀(vibration) = –0.75 + 0.004 × 1500 = –0.75 + 6 = **5.25**

Now back-transform to the original scale: vibration = 10\^5.25 ≈ **177827.94 m/s²**

So, a machine running at 1500 RPM is predicted to have a vibration intensity of about **177,828 m/s²**.

**Rubric:**

| Component                                               | Points |
|---------------------------------------------------------|--------|
| Correct substitution and linear calculation of log₁₀(y) | 1      |
| Correct back-transformation using exponentiation        | 1      |
| Final answer with units and context                     | 1      |

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### ✅ Q10 – *Interpreting the Impact of WLS*

**Model Answer (Full Credit – 3/3):**

1.  **Why WLS was needed**: The residual vs. fitted plot showed a fan shape, suggesting increasing variance of residuals — a violation of the constant variance (homoscedasticity) assumption. WLS was used to give less weight to points with higher residual variance.

2.  **Effect on estimation**: WLS minimizes the **weighted** sum of squared residuals instead of treating all points equally. This adjusts the regression line to better fit the **more reliable points**, reducing the influence of high-variance observations.

3.  **Impact on assumptions**: WLS helps correct heteroscedasticity. After applying WLS, the residual spread appeared more uniform across fitted values, making assumption checks more valid and improving inference accuracy.

**Rubric:**

| Component                                                     | Points |
|---------------------------------------------------------------|--------|
| Clear explanation of why OLS failed and WLS was needed        | 1      |
| Accurate description of how WLS adjusts the fitting process   | 1      |
| Discussion of improved assumption checks or plot improvements | 1      |
