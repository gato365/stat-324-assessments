### ✅ **Question Prompt**  
Write out the full regression equation for Model 2 using the estimated coefficients. Be as clear and explicit as possible, including the names of the variables and their estimated values. Then, interpret the coefficient for `email_clicks` in context.

---

### ✅ **Solution**

**1. Regression Equation (in context):**

$$
\hat{y}_i = 119.1 + 1.172 x_{1i} + 0.03553 x_{2i} + 0.05249  x_{3i}
$$

$\hat{y}_i$ - `ticket_sales` (predicted number of ticket sales in a marketing campaign)


$x_{1i}$ - `email_clicks` (number of email clicks in a marketing campaign)

$x_{2i}$ - `social_media_mentions` (number of social media mentions in a marketing campaign)

$x_{3i}$ - `ad_spend` (amount spent on ads in a marketing campaign)


---

**2. Interpretation of `email_clicks`:**

Holding `social_media_mentions` and `ad_spend` constant, for each additional email click in a marketing campaign, the model predicts an increase of approximately **1.172 units** in `ticket_sales`.

### ✅ **Question Prompt**

Using Model 2, predict the value of `ticket_sales` for a marketing campaign where there were **150 email clicks**, **223 social media mentions**, and **$623 in ad_spend**. Show your work.

Explain what your answer means in the context of the problem.

Then, explain whether this prediction should be trusted.

---

### ✅ **Solution**

#### Step 1: Use the Model 2 Equation  
$$
\hat{y}_i = 119.1 + 1.172 x_{1i} + 0.03553 x_{2i} + 0.05249 x_{3i}
$$

Plug in the values:

$$
\hat{y}_i = 119.1 + 1.172(150) + 0.03553(223) + 0.05249(623)
$$

$$
= 119.1 + 175.8 + 7.92419 + 32.69627
$$

$$
\hat{y}_i \approx 335.52
$$

---

#### Step 2: Interpret the Prediction

Based on the regression model, a campaign with 150 email clicks, 223 social media mentions, and $623 spent on ads is expected (average) to generate approximately **336 ticket sales**.

---

#### Step 3: Should the Prediction Be Trusted?

Yes, this prediction can be reasonably trusted because the input values (150 email clicks, 223 social media mentions, and $623 in ad spend) likely fall **within the range of the observed data** used to build the model. Since the prediction is not an extrapolation beyond the observed values and the model has a strong R² of 0.74, the estimate is likely reliable.
