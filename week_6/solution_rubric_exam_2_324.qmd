## Question 4

### Question:

Based on the best model output and supporting diagnostics (e.g., VIF values), is multicollinearity a problem in the model? Explain your reasoning clearly.

**Total Points:** 15

---

### Solution:

Based on the provided model output and VIF values, multicollinearity is **not considered a significant problem** in this model.

Here's the reasoning:

1.  **Examination of VIF Values:** The Variance Inflation Factors (VIFs) for the predictor variables are as follows:
    * Agriculture: 2.147
    * Education: 1.816
    * Catholic: 1.299
    * Infant.Mortality: 1.108

2.  **Interpretation of VIF Values:** VIF values quantify how much the variance of the estimate of a regression coefficient is increased due to multicollinearity. A commonly accepted guideline is that VIF values above 5 or 10 indicate problematic levels of multicollinearity.

3.  **Conclusion:** All the calculated VIF values in this model are well below the common thresholds of 5 or 10. The highest VIF is approximately 2.15 for Agriculture, which is far from suggesting a significant issue with multicollinearity. Therefore, the predictor variables in this model do not appear to be excessively correlated with each other to a degree that would severely impact the reliability or interpretation of the coefficient estimates.

**In summary, the low VIF values indicate that multicollinearity is not a significant concern for the `best_model_swiss`.**

## Question 8

### Question:
Plant scientists are investigating how the rate of photosynthesis (Y, measured in mols) in a newly developed rice variety responds to different light intensities (X, measured in lux). The experiments cover a wide range of light intensities, from very low light (e.g., 50 lux) up to moderately high levels (e.g., 15,000 lux), as rice photosynthesis tends to saturate. They found that the model fits the observed data extremely well across this broad spectrum of light. This model effectively captures the initial steep rise in photosynthesis at low light levels and the subsequent diminishing returns as light intensity increases further, before other factors become limiting.

Suppose we want to predict the photosynthetic rate for this rice variety at a light intensity of 7,500 lux. Show your work and explained your answer while mention any assumptions you are making.

A fake R output for this model might look like:

```r
# Model: lm(formula = photosynthetic_rate ~ log10(light_intensity_lux), data = rice_photosynthesis_study)
# Coefficients:
# (Intercept)                   log10(light_intensity_lux)
# -8.500                                 7.200
# ---
# Signif. codes:  0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1
# ---
# Residual standard error: 1.85 on 78 degrees of freedom
# Multiple R-squared: 0.844,	Adjusted R-squared: 0.842
# F-statistic: 423.2 on 1 and 78 DF,  p-value: < 2.2e-16
```





### Solution:

The model relates photosynthetic rate ($Y$) to the base-10 logarithm of light intensity ($X$). Based on the R output, the estimated linear model is:

$Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times \log_{10}(X)$

where:
- $Y$ is the predicted photosynthetic rate
- $X$ is the light intensity in lux
- $\beta_0$ is the intercept coefficient
- $\beta_1$ is the coefficient for $\log_{10}(X)$

From the provided R output:
- Estimated Intercept ($\hat{\beta}_0$): -8.500
- Estimated coefficient for $\log_{10}(\text{light\_intensity\_lux})$ ($\hat{\beta}_1$): 7.200

We want to predict the photosynthetic rate when the light intensity ($X$) is 7,500 lux.

First, calculate the base-10 logarithm of 7,500:
$\log_{10}(7500) \approx 3.875$

Now, substitute this value and the estimated coefficients into the model equation:
$Y = -8.500 + 7.200 \times 3.875$
$Y = -8.500 + 27.900$
$Y = 19.400$

Therefore, the predicted photosynthetic rate at a light intensity of 7,500 lux is approximately 19.400 mols.

**Explanation:** The model uses the logarithm of light intensity because the relationship between light and photosynthesis is often non-linear, exhibiting diminishing returns at higher intensities. Taking the log can linearize this relationship. By plugging the log of the target light intensity (7,500 lux) into the estimated linear equation, we obtain the predicted photosynthetic rate based on the relationship learned from the data.

**Assumption:** A key assumption being made is that the linear relationship between the photosynthetic rate and the log of light intensity, as modeled, holds true and is generalizable to a light intensity of 7,500 lux, which falls within or is close to the range of light intensities the model was trained on (50 to 15,000 lux). We also assume that other factors not included in this simple model (like CO2 concentration, temperature, etc.) are not limiting or are held constant in a way consistent with the data used to build the model.

## Question 9

### Question:

Based on the previous model, the slope coefficient for log$_{10}$(light_intensity_lux) is 7.2. What does this coefficient tell you about how photosynthetic rate changes with increasing light intensity? Explain using interpretation of a log$_{10}$ transformation in context.

**Total Points:** 15

---

### Solution:

The model is given by:
Photosynthetic Rate $= \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times \log_{10}(\text{Light Intensity})$

From the previous question, the estimated slope coefficient ($\hat{\beta}_1$) for $\log_{10}(\text{light\_intensity\_lux})$ is 7.200.

The slope coefficient in a regression model with a log-transformed predictor tells us about the change in the response variable associated with a *unit increase in the log-transformed predictor*. In the case of a $\log_{10}$ transformation, a one-unit increase in $\log_{10}(X)$ corresponds to a tenfold increase in the original variable $X$. This is because if $\log_{10}(X_2) = \log_{10}(X_1) + 1$, then $X_2 = 10^{\log_{10}(X_1) + 1} = 10^{\log_{10}(X_1)} \times 10^1 = X_1 \times 10$.

Therefore, the interpretation of the slope coefficient 7.200 in this context is:

For every tenfold increase in light intensity (measured in lux), the photosynthetic rate (measured in mols) is estimated to increase by 7.200 units, holding other factors constant (although no other factors are in this simple model).

**Explanation using context:**
The log$_{10}$ transformation is used here likely because the relationship between light intensity and photosynthetic rate is not linear in its original scale; it typically shows a rapid increase at low light levels and then plateaus or saturates at higher levels. The log transformation helps to linearize this relationship. The coefficient of 7.200 signifies the average change in photosynthetic rate for a proportional increase in light intensity (specifically, a 10-fold increase). This means that increasing light intensity from, say, 100 lux to 1000 lux is associated with an estimated 7.200 mols increase in photosynthetic rate, just as increasing it from 500 lux to 5000 lux is associated with a similar estimated increase of 7.200 mols. This reflects the diminishing *absolute* return as light intensity increases, although the return per tenfold increase remains constant in this log-linear model.

## Question 10 

### Question
A market analyst is studying the relationship between the number of unique monthly visitors to e-commerce websites (X) and their total monthly sales revenue (Y, in US dollars). The dataset includes a diverse range of websites, from small niche stores with a few thousand visitors (e.g., 1,000) to larger platforms attracting up to 1,000,000 or more visitors per month. The analyst found that a log-log model that provides a very strong and interpretable fit. This model suggests that a percentage change in website traffic tends to correspond to a relatively consistent percentage change in sales revenue across websites of different sizes.

Suppose we want to predict the monthly sales revenue for a website that receives 90,000 unique monthly visitors. Show your work and explained your answer while mention any assumptions you are making.

A fake R output for this model might look like:

```r
# Model: lm(formula = log10(monthly_sales_usd) ~ log10(unique_monthly_visitors), data = ecommerce_traffic_sales)
# Coefficients:
# (Intercept)                   log10(unique_monthly_visitors)

```

**Total Points:** 15

### Solution:

The model is $\log_{10}(Y) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times \log_{10}(X)$, where $Y$ is sales revenue and $X$ is unique visitors.
From the R output, the estimated coefficients are $\hat{\beta}_0 = 0.1500$ and $\hat{\beta}_1 = 1.1200$.

We need to predict $Y$ for $X = 90,000$.

1.  Calculate $\log_{10}(90000)$:
    $\log_{10}(90000) \approx 4.9542$

2.  Calculate the predicted $\log_{10}(Y)$:
    $\log_{10}(\hat{Y}) = 0.1500 + 1.1200 \times 4.9542$
    $\log_{10}(\hat{Y}) = 0.1500 + 5.5487$
    $\log_{10}(\hat{Y}) = 5.6987$

3.  Exponentiate to find the predicted $Y$:
    $\hat{Y} = 10^{5.6987} \approx 500000$

The predicted monthly sales revenue for a website with 90,000 unique monthly visitors is approximately $500,000. The log-log model indicates a proportional relationship; here, a 1% increase in visitors is associated with an estimated 1.12% increase in sales.

**Assumption:** The model is valid for predicting at 90,000 visitors, and other factors influencing sales are consistent with the model's data.
