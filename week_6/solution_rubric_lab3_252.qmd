### **Question:**

**Which of these two explanatory variables should be used to predict miles per gallon (mpg)? Explain your idea.**

### **Solution** 

We should use **`wt` (weight)** to predict `mpg`, because the linear model using `wt` provides a **better overall fit** than the model using `hp` (horsepower), based on the following reasons:

1.  **Higher R-squared**:

    -   The model with `wt` has an **R² of 0.7528**, meaning it explains about **75.3%** of the variability in `mpg`.
    -   The model with `hp` only explains **60.2%** of the variability in `mpg`.

2.  **Lower Residual Standard Error (RSE)**:

    -   The residual standard error for the `wt` model is **3.046**, while it is **3.863** for the `hp` model.
    -   This means predictions from the `wt` model are **more precise**, with less typical error.

### \*\*Rubric:\*

| **Component** | **Criteria** | **Points** |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------|
| **R-squared Comparison** | Correctly compares R² values and explains that **`wt` explains more variability in mpg** | 1.5 |
| **Residual Standard Error Comparison** | Recognizes that **`wt` has a lower RSE**, indicating more precise predictions | 1.5 |
