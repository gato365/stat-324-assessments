## Question 5

**Question:** Write out the null and alternative hypotheses for the global F-test in Model 2 in words and symbols. What does this test tell us?

### **Full Credit Answer**

**In Words:**

The global F-test for Model 2 tests whether the overall regression model is useful. Specifically, it tests whether at least one of the predictors (`hp`, `wt`) contributes significantly to explaining the variation in `mpg`.

-   **Null hypothesis (H‚ÇÄ):** None of the predictors explain variation in `mpg`. That is, all regression coefficients (excluding the intercept) are zero.
-   **Alternative hypothesis (H‚ÇÅ):** At least one predictor has a non-zero coefficient and contributes to the model.

**In Symbols:**

$$H_0: \beta_1 = \beta_2 = 0  $$ - **H‚ÇÅ:** At least one Œ≤·µ¢ ‚â† 0 (for i = 1 or 2)

## $$H_1: \text{ At least one }\beta_i \neq \text{ (for i = 1 or 2)} $$

| Component                           | Criteria                                                                                            | Points   |
|--------------------------|--------------------------|---------------------|
| **A. Hypotheses in Words**          | Clear and correct description of what $H_0$ and $H_1$ mean in context of model utility              | **0.75** |
| **B. Hypotheses in Symbols**        | Symbols correctly reflect all slopes = 0 ($H_0$) vs at least one ‚â† 0 ($H_1$)                        | **0.75** |
| **C. Interpretation of the F-test** | Explains that the F-test assesses overall model usefulness / whether at least one predictor matters | **0.75** |

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Example Partial Credit Scenarios

-   **2.0 pts:** Fully correct words and symbols, but vague or incomplete interpretation of what the F-test means.
-   **1.5 pts:** Only includes the hypotheses (words and symbols) but omits the interpretation.
-   **1.0 pt or less:** Misstates the meaning of hypotheses (e.g., confuses individual t-tests with global F-test).

## Question 8

**Question** Based on the partial F-test comparing Model 2 and Model 3, should we include drat in the model? Justify your answer using statistical evidence and practical reasoning.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Answer Key**

**Short Answer:**\
No, we should likely **exclude `drat`** from the model.

**Justification Using Statistical Evidence:**

-   The partial F-test comparing Model 2 (`mpg ~ hp + wt`) and Model 3 (`mpg ~ hp + wt + drat`) yielded:

    -   **F = 1.73**, **p-value = 0.1988**
    -   This p-value is well above 0.05, indicating that **`drat` does not significantly improve** the model‚Äôs explanatory power.
    -   The **coefficient for `drat`** in Model 3 was not statistically significant (p = 0.198755).

**Justification Using Practical Reasoning:** - Since `drat` does not contribute statistically and the change in adjusted $R^2$, AIC, and BIC between Models 2 and 3 is **minimal**, there is no strong evidence of practical gain.

-   Including unnecessary variables can lead to overfitting and reduced model interpretability.

| **1.5**         | Only gives statistical justification, no mention of practical relevance                            |
