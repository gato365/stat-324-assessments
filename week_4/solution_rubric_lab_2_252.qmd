## Question 12

What makes the Chi-Square Test of Independence different from the other statistical techniques we discussed so far? Explain your answer.

### **Solution (Full Credit – 3/3)**

The **Chi-Square Test of Independence** is different from other statistical techniques discussed so far because it is used to assess whether **two categorical variables** are associated or independent. Unlike t-tests or z-tests, which compare **means** of numerical data, the Chi-Square Test works with **counts (frequencies)** in a contingency table.

It does **not assume normality** and does not involve means, proportions, or standard deviations directly. Instead, it compares **observed counts** in each cell of a table to **expected counts** under the assumption of independence.

In summary, the key differences are:

* It’s used for **two categorical variables**
* It analyzes **frequency data**, not means or proportions
* It uses a **Chi-Square distribution** for the test statistic
